Chisel
======

**Pull requests are welcome!** Also, please submit an issue if you encounter a prolem.

Chisel is an open-source alternative to the various different editors for Genesis, built upon the solid base of Sledge Editor. It uses modern brush editing and a fast rendering platform to create beautiful maps. It is written in .NET and uses OpenGL as a rendering platform.

Currently, Chisel supports version 1.34 of the Genesis 3DT files. We are working on full support for the Genesis 3DT Maps and will be updating Chisel quite frequently.

The Chisel Editor is GPL. All other components are LGPL.
