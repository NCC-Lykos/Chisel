Chisel
======

**Pull requests are welcome!** Also, please submit an issue if you encounter a prolem.

Chisel is an open-source alternative to the various different editors for Genesis, built upon the solid base of Chisel Editor. It uses modern brush editing and a fast rendering platform to create beautiful maps. It is written in .NET and uses OpenGL as a rendering platform.

Currently, Chisel supports version 1.34 of the Genesis 3DT files. We are working on full support for the Genesis 3DT Maps and will be updating Chisel quite frequently.

While progress is slow, I have every intention of continuing work on this project. The current focus is on Goldsource support. After that, Source will be added, followed by a plugin system and more features.

The Chisel Editor is GPL. All other components are LGPL.
